# Mall Navigator Prototype üó∫Ô∏èüõçÔ∏è

Choose a start and end location to show the best path through the mall to reach your destination.

This proof-of-concept demonstrates how to use **folium** and **streamlit** to dynamically show geographic information (geojson) on an interactive dashboard. This page was created entirely in Python.

Similar navigation dashboards can be easily created for hospitals, university campuses, and more.

## Dashboard
Click [here](https://juaneslamilla-mallnavigationprototype-mallnav-4g5nq6.streamlit.app) to access the Streamlit dashboard.

## Installation
If you wish to run the Streamlit dashboard locally, you can use the following commands.

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install dependencies.

```console
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ streamlit run MallNav.py
```
